                As a member of the Student-led Environmental Stewardship
                Initiative (SESI), I played an active role in promoting
                environmental awareness, particularly in the border region. Our
                club carried out various service projects focused on
                sustainability and conservation. One of our biggest projects
                involved securing and utilizing a $300 environmental grant to
                build a HÃ¼gelkultur mound at Keystone Heritage Park in El Paso,
                which helps improve soil health and promote biodiversity.
                Through this initiative and other activities like community
                cleanups and educational outreach, we worked to spread knowledge
                about sustainable practices and encouraged greater environmental
                responsibility within our local community.

              <h1>El Paso Fighting Hunger Food Bank</h1>
              <h4>
                At the El Paso Fighting Hunger Food Bank, I volunteered to help
                distribute food to people and families in need, especially
                during critical times like the COVID-19 pandemic. Our efforts
                aimed to support the less fortunate by provided access to
                important essential food iterms and long-term supplies.
                Volunteering at the food bank allowed me to witness firsthand
                the impact of poverty and food insecurity in our community.
                Through teamwork and dedication, we provided much-needed relief
                to struggling families, fostering a stronger and more
                compassionate El Paso community. It was an amazing experience to
                be a helping hand and to know that I can make a personal impact
                in people lives, no matter how small.

                As an active member of the Institute of Electrical and
                Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Mentorship Group, I provided
                guidance and support to peers with similar career interests and
                goals. This experience has given me shared insights on academic
                and professional development. In the same way, I am able to help
                others navigate challenges in engineering and technology, the
                same challlanges that I faced earlier in my career.. This
                experience allowed me to build strong connections, enhance my
                leadership skills, and create an engineering community. Being
                part of this group not only helped others grow but also gave me
                the opportunity to develop personally and professionally.
